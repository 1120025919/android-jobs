Wiredcraft招聘 Android 高级工程师
==========

#### 公司介绍

https://wiredcraft.com/

Here's a few reasons on why you'll have a blast, guaranteed:

- **We build sh*t that matters for some of the biggest organizations in the world, from Google to Starbucks and the UN.** We built the software running the elections of Myanmar (not kidding) and fixed HR with machine learning for billion-dollar companies.
- **We're wicked smart, passionate and don't settle on quality.** You'll get to learn from some of the smartest folks in town and grow your skills like never before.
- **We care about each other... a lot!** We try really hard to keep everybody happy, whether it's with perks (free snacks, Macbook, ergonomic chair, books, standing desks...), flexible working hours, company trips or generous vacation and remote work policies. [Our playbook has all the deets](http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/rules-and-benefits/).
- **We use cool tech and encourage people to learn.** [Most of our colleagues are T-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills). If you're not, we'll help you get there. We used Node.js, Drip campaigns, React, A/B testing, Figma, Docker and design thinking before it was cool. (We know, so hipster).
- **We have a strong culture built on trust.** We're transparent and treat our colleagues like responsible adults. [Read more about our culture in our playbook](http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/culture/).
- **We're in Berlin, Shanghai, and soon NYC.** We also occasionally have folks moving around offices or working remotely.
